<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Welcome to Hugo, Inc. ("Hugo," "we," or "us"). Hugo is a service that helps find places relevant to you through the use of your friends' location data. Hugo collects your friends' shared location data from checkins and photos in your social network accounts to build maps, search and a newsfeed that allow better and quicker decisions on restaurants, bars, hotels, sights or anything with a location.</p></p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p>

<h3>1.	HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</h3>

<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a public location and content sharing platform, and that other Users may search for, see, use, and share any of the User Content that you make publicly available through the Service.  Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use at http://www.hugoapps.com/tos.html.</p>

<p>We collect the following types of information about you:<p>

<p>Information you provide us directly: You may choose to provide us with certain information such as your first and last name, location, or e-mail address if you correspond with us directly.  We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service.</p>

<p>Information we may receive from third parties: We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect or other services we may let you link in the future, by "following," "liking," adding the Hugo application, linking your account to the Hugo service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Hugo. We may now or in the future add additional third-party connections. This information could include, but is not limited to an access token necessary to access that service, any information you have made public in connection with that service, and any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, including without limitation your name, gender, location, tips, status indicators, photo metadata, profile information, check-in information, public photos, likes or dislikes, and other information.  We will also collect your friends’ names, their check-in locations, and your connection to those friends in order to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates of your friends’ interests and activities. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Hugo Service.  If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.

If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our "Invite friends" feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your contact list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by inviting a friend to Hugo through the "Invite friends" feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list.

Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.</p>

The "Find friends" feature allows you to choose to locate friends either through (i) social media sites (such as Facebook, Foursquare, or Twitter) or (ii) through a search of names and usernames on Hugo. If you choose to find your friends through social media sites, then you understand that the use of such information is governed by the social media site’s privacy policies and any applicable account settings on that site.
